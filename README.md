# json_to_html
Generates an html file based on json data retrieved from an API; using GO.
File generated would be placed in a subfolder (\posts) based on the location of the program.

Program would likely be made more efficient after some refactoring (function separation based on their purpose; not creating extra objects to temporary store the json objects; other), which would also make usage of unit tests easier.
